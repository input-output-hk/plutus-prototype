{-% Last piece puzzle, adapted from nofib/spectral/last-piece.
    This is a solver for a jigsaw problem:
        see https://www.nicklevine.org/contest/2003/index.html.

  I've removed prettyprinting code for solutions and replaced Map.Map with an
  association list.  The original version collected the entire search tree,
  including paths which led to failure, and the PLC version quickly ran out of
  memory. This version prunes the search tree to keep only successful paths.  It
  still doesn't work on the CEK machine (I don't know about the CK machine: that
  took forever).
